# React SPA

The front end is a modern React Single Page Application. It uses local storage to maintain state, and Chakra-UI as a
component library. The Arad front-end is written in typescript, and we generate types using OpenAPI definitions from the
back-end. The API abstraction uses `fetch()` under the hood.
