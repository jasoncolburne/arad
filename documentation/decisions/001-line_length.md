# 120 Character Maximum Line Length for Source Files

**Date**: 2022-07-04

**Decider**: [@jasoncolburne](https://github.com/jasoncolburne)

**Status**: decided

**User Story**: As an ARAD developer, I'd like to be able to review as much code per line in GitHub and in my editor
without line wrapping. 


## Considered Options
- 80 characters
- 100 characters
- 120 characters
- 160 characters


## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: 120 characters (see below).

**Positive Consequences**: <!-- optional -->
- Can review in GitHub (max 125 characters in review mode)
- Fits on a typical editor screen when maximized (160 didn't)
- More content on screen than 80 or 100 characters
