Accessible Research Article Database

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/jasoncolburne/arad/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/jasoncolburne/arad/tree/main)
(sometimes this may say failed if we do something like change documentation and cancel the build to save ci credits)

*This project is under construction and reality may not yet match design.*

The Accessible Research Article Database is, as the name implies, designed to be accessible in every way. The UI employs
a high contract colour theme, large font without serifs, and minimal controls.

The code is permissively licensed and well documented. It is designed to be discoverable, and the developer experience
has been tuned for rapid iteration. It should prove as a starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to develop a
simple distributed app, and the architecture performs well at scale, with modifications for specific use cases called
out to aid others.

For more details, dig into the documentation.
